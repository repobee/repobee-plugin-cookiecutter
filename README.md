# repobee-plugin-cookiecutter
This is a simple `cookiecutter` template for
[RepoBee](https://github.com/repobee/repobee) plugins. It should provide you
with everything you need to quickly write a plugin.

## Requirements
The only requirement for using this template is to have
[cookiecutter](https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter) installed. It's on PyPi,
so you can install it with `pip install cookiecutter` (or whichever variation
works for you).

## Quick-use
1. Execute `python3 -m cookicutter gh:repobee/repobee-plugin-cookiecutter`
2. Complete the setup.
3. That's all there is to it! You should now have a directory called
   `repobee-<plugin_name>` in the current working directory.
